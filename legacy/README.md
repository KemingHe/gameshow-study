# 🎮 Arnab's CSE 3241 Game Show! 🎮

This is Keming He's self-hosted version of Dr. Arnab Nandi's "vibe coding" work for database education.

## 🧠 About the Original

Dr. Nandi created this with Claude 3.7 Sonnet as a practical example of his research on LLMs in database education. His work explores how AI tools can enhance learning rather than replace it. This game show demonstrates LLMs' potential to create engaging educational tools while preserving pedagogical value.
